        // the HTTP response will be handled.

            // object declared above is available in this function even though this function
            // executes long after the request is sent and long after this function is
            // instantiated. This fact is CRUCIAL to the workings of XHR in ordinary
            // applications.

            // You can get all kinds of information about the HTTP response.
